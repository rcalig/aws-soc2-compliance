# Week 1 â€“ Access Controls (SOC 2 CC 6.x)

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
This week focuses on **access controls**.  
We want to generate repeatable evidence for the following SOC 2 controls:

- **CC 6.1.2** â€“ MFA enforced (IAM_USER_MFA_ENABLED)  
- **CC 6.1.3** â€“ Strong password policy (IAM_PASSWORD_POLICY)  
- **CC 6.1.9** â€“ RBAC via groups (IAM_USER_GROUP_MEMBERSHIP_CHECK)  
- **CC 6.2.1** â€“ Admin access limited (AdministratorAccess policy check)  
- **CC 6.1.7 (Root Account MFA)** â€“ Extra check for root MFA + no access keys  

All evidence is collected in the **S3 evidence bucket** created in Week -1 under the `cc6/` prefix.
