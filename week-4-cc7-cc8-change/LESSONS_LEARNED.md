# Week 4 â€“ Lessons Learned

1. ECR scans can be automated using `describe-image-scan-findings`.  
2. CloudWatch alarm data can serve as evidence of real-time deployment monitoring.  
3. Semgrep integration with GitLab provides a repeatable static code scan pipeline.  
4. IAM least-privilege for GitLab CI roles is essential to limit artifact upload access.  
5. Evidence structure under `/cc7/scans/` keeps audit reports consistent across weeks.
